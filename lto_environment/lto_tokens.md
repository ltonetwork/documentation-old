# LTO Tokens

LTO tokens are present on the public blockchain of LTO Network. They have two purposes:
* First of all they are used to pay transaction fees when you interact with the blockchain. [Read more](/lto_environment/lto_protocol/transaction_fees.md) about transaction fees.
* Second they are used for staking. By staking a node (either by running it or leasing to it) you receive rewards for the blocks forged by that node proportionate to your stake.

LTO tokens are not tradeable and can come into or leave the network via the [bridge](lto_environment/troll_bridge.md). For liquidity the [LTO erc-20 tokens]() are used. The LTO tokens and LTO erc-20 tokens share the same supply. They can be exchanged for each other using the [bridge]() in a 1:1 ratio.
