# Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. How much LTO do I need to have in order to start the mining process?

In order to activate mining, the node needs not less than 1000 LTO \(for testnet we can always provide you with that, do not hesitate to contact us\).

### 2. Where can i get the link for last mainnet state?

[_**Last Maninet State.**_](SET LINK)

### 3. What is the incentive to run my own full node instead of leasing my coins \(assume I have 1000\)?

More revenue if you have enough people leasing to you and payout is not 100%. Also you can provide services on LTO Platform with your node. Running a node might be profitable later on but it's not at the moment. If it is it's only marginal.

### 4. I want to automatically send my tokens to multiple wallets on the LTO platform. Is there a program or bot?

Yes, there are payout scripts that are used by node owners to pay leasers. These can also be used/adjusted to do other automateded transfers, e.g., [_**WavesLPoSDistributer**_](SET LINK)_**.**_

### 5. What is the size of data that can be stored as Data TranSactions in Waves? And what is the type of data that can be stored?

Please check [_**Data transaction**_](/lto_environment/lto_protocol/data_transaction.md) article.
