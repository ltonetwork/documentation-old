# LTO Testnet

**The testnet**\(test network\) is an alternative LTO blockchain, to be used _**for testing**_. Testnet LTO tokens are separate and distinct from actual LTO tokens, and are never supposed to have any value. This allows application developers or testers to experiment without having to use real LTO or worrying about breaking the main LTO chain.

Testnet is used a lot for developing purposes, assume you are building a new feature and its require you to send and receive LTO and you don't have any real LTO or you don't want to waste with mistakes, here you use test network \(testnet\).

## Mainnet vs Testnet

A mainnet and a testnet are two separate networks that operate independently from each other.

|  | Mainnet | Testnet |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Purpose | LTO Functional blockchain | LTO Testing environment |
| Transactions | LTO real transactions stored on actual blockchain | Fake transactions |
| LTO Tokens | Posses real value | No monetary value |
| Transactions frequency | High | Low |
| Mining | Possible to earn rewards | Not possible |
