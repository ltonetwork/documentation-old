# Troll Bridge

Because the supply is seperated over two different blockchains (LTO Mainnet and Ethereum), a bridge has been build to let tokens travel from one side to the other. Both tokens can be exchanged for one another in a 1:1 ratio. 

## Fees

When moving from erc-20 to mainnet, there is a 40 LTO transaction fee (rewarded to the miner). When moving from mainnet to erc-20 there is a percentage burned. This percentage started at 55% after the ICO mid januari, and decreases to zero during 6 months. (INSERT IMAGE OR LINK TO BURNING GRAPH).

## Function

This bridge is implemented to protect public sale investors, from investors who bought in presale with a bonus. Investors that bought in presale have received mainnet tokens, while people who bought in public sale have received erc-20 tokens. If presale investors want to take a profit (at the cost of the public sale investors) they have to burn a percentage of their tokens.
