# What is LTO Network


LTO Network is hybrid blockchain solution for decentralized workflows. It enables trustless B2B collaborations in a GDPR compliant way with features as anchoring, ad-hoc private chains, a permissionless public chain, and more.

# Main LTO Network Features

* _**Anchoring**_ for proof of existance on the public chain.
* _**Ad-hoc private chains**_ for decentralized, GDPR-compliant workflows.
* _**Waves-NG protocol**_ which greatly increases TPS capacity because miners no longer compete to verify transactions.
* _**Fair Proof-of-Stake(FPoS)**_ algorithm to find a ditributed concensus. _(Lease Proof-of-Importance coming soon)_
