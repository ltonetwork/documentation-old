# Waves Platform Components

# 1. LTO Wallet

* It’s a web-based wallet that allows you to view and interact with your tokens in a web-based view.

* It offers easy ways of interacting with the [bridge](/lto_environment/troll_bridge.md). It’s also constantly being updated.

* It allows you to create and anchor hashes of documents with an easy to use drag and drop system.

# 2. Nodes

Nodes are a critical part of our ecosystem. [Run a LTO node](/waves-full-node/how-to-install-a-node/how-to-install-a-node.md), help process transactions, ask the community to [lease their LTO]() to you and get paid for securing the network.

**Features:**

* A hosted server is adequate to run a node and no mining rigs or specialist hardware are required.
* It allows to mine LTO and to act as a leasing pool to aggregate mining power from other users.
* Receiving rewards from the network by leasing your balance to a full node.

**Note.** The current number of nodes is X in Y different countries.

## 2.1 Public nodes

* You don’t need any fancy hardware, just a simple hosted server and at least 1,000 LTO.
* You can run a public mining pool and have users lease their funds to you, thereby increasing your profits and sharing them with the community.

You can find the full list of LTO nodes for leasing with their corresponding address [_**HERE.**_](http://dev.pywaves.org/LTO/nodes/)

## 2.2 Anchoring nodes

* Anchoring nodes perform the same tasks as public nodes and don't need any additional hardware.
* Anchoring nodes can perform anchoring transactions on the public chain.

## 2.3 Full nodes

* Full nodes can be used to access layer 2 of the LTO Network. These are private minitiure blockchains that are used to perform decentralized workflows.
* Using a full node you can either start or join (if invited) a decentralized workflow and add / verify updates to this process.
* Depending on the amount of private chains that are active, the nodes requirements increase a little. However, a hosted server is most likely adequate enough.

# 3. Bridge

* The bridge is used to transfer the liquid erc-20 tokens to mainnet and the other way around.
* A static fee (miner reward) applies when transfering to mainnet.
* A Dynamic burn applies when transfering to erc-20. [Needs link to graph or article]()

# 4. MainNet / TestNet

1. **MainNet** - this is the real deal, the live LTO Network blockchain where you in the worst case could lose money if you are not careful. You can access the mainnet via any node. it's integrated with the GUI in the LTO wallet, allowing anyone to use it without any technical knowledge or blockchain downloads.
2. **TestNet **- this is the test version of the Waves blockchain. [here](https://github.com/wavesplatform/Waves/releases) you'll find always the latest versions and newest features before they go live.
