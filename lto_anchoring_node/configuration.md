## Configuration

Before you run the node you will need to configure a few environment variables per service:

**Public Node Container**
1. LTO_WALLET_SEED: The seed of your wallet. Your account will need at least 1000 LTO to be able to start mining.
2. LTO_WALLET_SEED_BASE58: The seed of your wallet but then base58 encoded. This will overwrite the LTO_WALLET_SEED
3. LTO_WALLET_PASSWORD: This password is used to encrypt your seed on disk.
4. LTO_API_KEY: Choose an api-key this need to be same in the `Anchor service` so that is able to communicate with the public node.
5. LTO_NETWORK: Choose the network you want to connect your node to. The options are: `MAINNET` and `TESTNET` (default is`MAINNET`).

For other options check out: [Public Node on Github](https://github.com/legalthings/docker-public-node)

**Anchor service**
1. LTO_API_KEY: The same ApiKey as was set in the `Public Node`.
